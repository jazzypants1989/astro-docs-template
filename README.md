# Astro Content Collections Docs Template!

This is a template that leverages the Content Collections API to automatically create a documentation website based on markdown files. It looks inside the contents folder and it's internal folder structure to create a Table of Contents. It also checks through each markdown file for headings. Astro internally converts each heading into an h2 with a linkable `id`, so we simply run a script on each page which looks for these headings and makes a "On this Page" link-list. This allows for a classic recognizable layout with an overall table of contents on the left side, and a table of contents for just what's on each page on the right side.
